              Respond to queries on Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News and other 3rd

            <li>
              Work with people to figure out if Vercel is suitable for their use

            I'm learning typescript now. I like to write more tech blogs thats
            going to help a lot of new developers like Lee Robinson at Vercel
            does.

            Rethinking reactivity is one of the best talk and I think everyone
            should watch this, This shows how a well thought framework can solve
            all the requirements of a project with so much less Javascript.

            I think one of common question would be setting up a custom domain
            and poing mx record to some other service like gsuite. In short term
            I would point to all the docs for this but if this a very common
            problem I would also do few videos and put them in youtube.
